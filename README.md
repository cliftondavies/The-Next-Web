## Project Implementation

### Content & Structure

The webpage consists of seven main sections.

Firstly, there is the **Nav Bar** created with a list of links.

Then the **Latest Articles** section, made up of a heading, a couple of buttons and four articles.

Following that section is the **Recent Articles** section, structured with a heading, seven articles, two ad spaces and a link to more recent articles.

There are two book sections - **First Book** and **Second Book**. In both sections, a heading and a paragraph are used to represent the book's title and introduction, respectively.

Sandwiched between the two book sections is a **Community** section also structured with a heading, seven articles and a link to more articles.

A **Guides** section follows the Second Book section. This part contains a heading, four articles, an ad space, and a link to other guides as well.

The page ends with a **Footer** section mostly made up of a heading, two sets of footer links, a paragraph, and a couple of images.

### Layout & Presentation

**CSS Flexbox** is mainly used to layout and align elements on the webpage.

Barring the **First Book** section, this technique is employed in all the other sections to layout page elements, from links in the nav bar to articles and guides in the sections that follow.

The empty elements representing section headings, links to more articles, and footer images are positioned as absolute, while a back-to-top link is fixed to the bottom.
